# Availability relative date

Restrict module and section access based on relative dates.

## Idea

This availability condition makes it easy to show modules or sections only x days/weeks/months
  - before / after course start date (THX to Frederik Milling Pytlick)
  - before / after course end date
  - after user enrolment date
  - after end of enrolment period
  - after the completion of an activity (THX to Stefan Hanauska and Daniel Poggenpohl)
